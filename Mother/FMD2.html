    <h1>About Mother Job !</h1>
    <div id="ka" > 
    <h6>Being a mom is like no other job in the world, and her job is never done. Unlike a typical 8-to-5 job, motherhood is a “career” often motivated by pure, unwavering love. While she’s responsible for so much, often it may feel as if she goes unappreciated, or at least under-appreciated.       Let’s reach out to all the moms in our lives to remind them how loved and appreciated they are, and let’s honor and celebrate them with this blessing.</h6>
